# Windows(.h) Process Memory Utilities
This is a small set of utilities that minimize boilerplate code when working with the memory of other processes in the form of a namespace containing some relatively trivial but repetitive functions. Rather than re-writing these functions for each individual project, I wrote them all once, and grouped them in a namespace for my convenience (and hopefully yours too). 

## Building
This is just a source/header combo that contains the relevant namespace, and is light enough to build along with the rest of your project (though Windows.h isn't exactly light, I assume you've already included it in your project if you plan on working with process memory through the Windows Api -- this is meant to make that process less tedious). However if you really want to go that route, I have included a Makefile that will build an object and library file for you (using clang).
